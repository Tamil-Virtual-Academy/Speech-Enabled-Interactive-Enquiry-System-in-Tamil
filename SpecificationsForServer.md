# Server Specifications
The following are the specifications for the server. They do not have to be followed strictly, but generally, more processing power (more cores in the CPU and more RAM) will allow more users to access it at the same time.

A branded server (HP/DELL/LENOVO) with a configuration that is close to the following should be good enough,
- Processor : Intel Xeon Processor
- RAM: 32/64 GB
- HDD: 2/4 TB SATA + 120/256 GB SSD (SSD optional)
- OS: Ubuntu LTS (Latest Version)

Note: *'/' stands for 'or'
